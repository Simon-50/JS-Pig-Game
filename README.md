# JS Game project

A simple two-player dice game built with HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.

### How to Play

Hosted with github pages [here](https://simon-50.github.io/JS-Pig-Game/).

1. Click the `Roll Dice` button to roll a virtual die.
2. If the roll is not 1, the number is added to your `Current` score.
3. Click `Hold Score` to add your `Current` score to your `Total` and end your turn.
4. If you roll a 1, your `Current` score resets to 0, and it's the other player's turn.
5. Be the first player to reach 50 to win!
6. Play again using `New Game`

### Enjoy the game! ðŸŽ‰
